        Hello my name is Adi. I am a senior at LASA and the Red Cross Club's
        Vice President this year. I enjoy playing video games, tutoring other
        people, and exploring nature, whether at Zilker Park or in the Great
        Smoky Mountains. I hope to see you soon!

        Hi! My name is Margret, and I am in 10th grade at LASA. When I'm not busy with homework or Red Cross work, you can find me reading and/or obsessively organizing things. I can't wait to see you at our meetings!
